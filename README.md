Hello, welcome to my Page!

Here is some informations about my repository;

This is my Engineering project repository. This repository contains PNG Datasets, CSV Datasets, Python Tensorflow Code, Model estimation, Model testing and other pretrained codes.

CSV Datasets contain Absorbance, Reflectance and Intensity values of each measurement. These datasets were created using the NIR spectrometer and the Wavelength range is 900-1700nm.

PNG Datasets were created using absorbance and reflectance CSV datasets.
